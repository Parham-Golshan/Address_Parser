# Address Parser
## Overview
Address Parser is a Python Flask application that parses street addresses and extracts the street name and house number. The application provides two endpoints for parsing addresses:

- /parser-simple: Parses simple addresses in the format "street name house number", and returns the street name and house number as separate values.
- /parser-medium: Parses medium addresses in formats like "Am BÃ¤chle 23" or "Auf der Vogelwiese 23 b", and returns the street name and house number as separate values.
- /parser-complex: Parses complex addresses that may contain additional information, such as prefix or numeric street names like "Calle 39 No 1540", and returns the street name and house number as separate values.
